# JAVA SYNTAX REFERENCE

As a JavaScript developer I made a quick reference file for an overview of Java syntax.
Feel free to add to this if you stumble across it.

I think I still prefer C# ðŸ¤”

## types
```java
  int myInt = 2147483647;
  short myShort = 12345;
  float myFloat = 0.5f;
  double myDouble = 3.14159265358979;
  char myChar = 'A';
  boolean myBool = true;
  System.out.println("maximun int is: " + myInt);
  System.out.println("anything shorter uses short: " + myShort);
  System.out.println("floats end in f: " + myFloat);
  System.out.println("a double holds 8 bytes (64 bits) and is more precise than a float: " + myDouble);
  System.out.println("single character with single quotes: " + myChar);
  System.out.println("boolean is true/false: " + myBool);
